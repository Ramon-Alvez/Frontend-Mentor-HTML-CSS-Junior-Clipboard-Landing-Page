## My process 💻✒

### Built with 🧱🛠

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned 📚

Not exactly what I learned, it's more of a doubt. 

When using the grid in a more real situation like creating this landing page I realized that I didn't really know what to do, and I think that my initial grid configuration wasn't very good (it seems wrong to be honest, since it doesn't change nothing other than the height of the containers, which could be changed normally).

Maybe I should have configured more columns in the grid to position the logos and the 3 independent sections at the bottom. Or maybe I could have just left it alone and needed to set up a "local grid". 

Anyway, if anyone wants to help me with this, feel free to call me via message. 

### Continued development 🚀

My current goal is to finish all the FrontEnd Mentor challenges, to train and learn in the process. After finishing all HTML and CSS challenges, I will start JavaScript lessons.

### Useful resources 🎒

- [Icons - Font Awesome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUq6NiOXPw8) - This helped me because I was unable to use Font Awesome icons. This video showed that I was using icons from a different version of the embedded link.
